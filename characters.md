## Additional Crew/Characters 


### Steampunk Numbat: The Last Tinkerer
**Concept:** A tiny, goggle-wearing numbat with a **mechanical tail** (part tool, part antenna) and a **miniature brass backpack** filled with salvaged tech. Its stripes glow faintly with bioluminescent paint, a desperate attempt to signal for help in the dark. Maybe it’s holding a **broken pocket watch**, symbolizing time running out for its species. Or a **wrench**, because it’s still trying to fix what humans broke.

**Vibe:** *"I’m the last of my kind, but I’ll be damned if I don’t leave behind blueprints for a better world."* 

Goggles on, wrench in paw, still trying to fix the unfixable.

### Steampunk Dhole: The Ghost of the Wild
**Concept:** A lone dhole with **copper-plated fur patches** (from old machinery it’s scavenged) and **one cybernetic eye** that flickers with the memories of its lost pack. Its collar is studded with **tiny vials of seeds**, a last-ditch effort to regrow the forests it once roamed. Maybe it’s howling at a **smog-choked moon**, or curled around a **steam-powered lantern** that projects holograms of its extinct family.

**Vibe:** *"I haunt the ruins of what you took from me."*

Howling at a world that forgot them, but *never* forgetting.
