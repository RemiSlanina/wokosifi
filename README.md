# Worst Kind of Sci Fi 

A markdown zine. 

The dubious adventures of the USS Tittle-Tattle
A Ridiculous Journey Through Time and Space

_A dadaist anti-capitalist space satire in markdown form._

Join the dubious adventures of the **USS Tittle-Tattle**  
— a gossip-leaking, coolant-dripping vessel run by:

- **Uncaptain Unstabilia** (navigates feelings, not space)
- **CALM-P.U.T.E.R.** (AI co-pilot, prone to whale songs)
- **C.A.F.F.Y.** (technician, part android, part espresso)
- **Beak-onomist** (radical seagull, conspiracy theorist)
- **Wendy the GalactiCat** (saves the ship by napping)

## Contents

- Episodes (zine-style)
- Ads from evil galactic corporations
- Character files & lore fragments
- Colophons (medieval closing notes, badly copied by trembling scribes)
