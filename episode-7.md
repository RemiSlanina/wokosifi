# Worst Kind of Sci-Fi: The Dubious Adventures of the USS *Tittle-Tattle*
In the year 21XX, humanity‚Äôs last hope was a ship held together by duct tape, caffeine, and sheer spite. On its heroic journey through spacetime, it saved many a day. But this is not that story. This is the story of the USS Tittle-Tattle, a vessel that maneuvered through forgotten trash asteroid belts¬Æ and satire, crewed by the not-so-heroic misfits‚Äî(not) led by Uncaptain Unstabilia, who was constantly falling in love with inanimate objects (and especially her one-and-only true AI system, CALM-P.U.T.E.R.).

One at a time, they brought chaotic disaster to the multiverses‚Ä¶ But let‚Äôs begin where every good story tends to begin.
Somewhere in **the** middle.

## Episode 7: Pizza Reactor Meltdown ‚Äî A Cheesy Romance
**WARNING:** This transmission contains cheese-based horror, unchecked capitalism, and at least one (1) seagull with a god complex. Proceed with caution and a snack.

### Scene One: ‚ÄúIn Which the Ship Begins to Smell Like Existential Cheese‚Äù
We are onboard the USS *Tittle-Tattle*, **a** porary space ship on its way to existential dread. In charge is Uncaptain Unstabilia, the living collection of hats and a tad **of** human DNA getting on in years. The space was vast, the stars were bright... mostly... but so far away you couldn‚Äôt actually care less. The blinking light on the well-shaped toaster **that** the Uncaptain was currently in a one-sided relationship with was brighter.

No one knew where it was coming from. But everyone knew where it was going.

The ship was quiet.
Too quiet, considering it had just been hit by a deep-fried pizza torpedo of existential significance.

No one knew where it was coming from. But everyone knew where it was going.

Uncaptain Unstabilia opened the ventilation shaft and was flooded by waves of particles confusing themselves with vanilla flavor. A low jingle echoed through the coolant vents: *‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt spell doom without YUM!‚Äù* Dread crept through her veins.

*‚ÄúWe are infected with capitalist advertisement slogans!‚Äù* she coughed.

‚Ä¶Pilot currently sobbing into **a** star chart.
Deploying whale sounds.

![doodle of a whale](/assets/doodles/whale.png)

---
Eerie sounds filled the air. It seemed her co-pilot, CALM-P.U.T.E.R., had cracked under stress ‚Äî *again*. He always played whale sounds when overwhelmed.

Uncaptain Unstabilia rushed toward C.A.F.F.Y. the technician, who was snoring on a stool in the command section of the USS *Tittle-Tattle*. C.A.F.F.Y. (*Caffeinated Android Fixing Faults, Yes*) was a stupid name, yes‚Ä¶
But he could repair anything that wasn‚Äôt too sensitive to coffee stains.

*‚ÄúC.A.F.F.Y.! C.A.F.F.Y., wake up!‚Äù* She grabbed his shoulders. *‚ÄúC.A.F.F.Y.!‚Äù* Nothing. She shook him violently; it only lulled him deeper into sleep.

*‚ÄúCAFF! This is an emergency! Wake, you woke piece of‚Äî‚Äù*
*‚Äú...more espresso‚Ä¶ double-ended wrench‚Ä¶ roasted duck tape‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Uncaptain Unstabilia let go of the man (or android, or in-between ‚Äî potentially a hybrid).

The vehicle started shaking violently. Panic overcame her.
- The technician: in the land of dreams.
- The AI co-pilot: glitched.
- Who would repair the ship?

Do you want to know? But only after the‚Äî

### \[CAPTAIN‚ÄôS LOG]
- **Stardate:** Um.
- **Ship:** *Tittle-Tattle*
- **Mood:** Mildly grieving, possibly lactose-intolerant.

We‚Äôve been hit by what appears to be‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶some kind of deep-fried emotional warhead?
Reactor readings **are** unstable.
Cheese levels **are** rising.
I tried to reroute power but spilled onion tea into the backup reactor interface, and now it smells like soup and failure.
CALM-P.U.T.E.R. is playing whale sounds again.
C.A.F.F.Y. is asleep.
I may be in love with my co-pilot.
And/or the pizza.
Sending **a** diagnostic ping.
Or **a** prayer.
I no longer distinguish.
**Note to self:** If I die, tell my Zen AI I loved him.
‚Ä¶No, don‚Äôt send that. Delete. Delete. Oh no. It transmitted.

---
Uncaptain Unstabilia frantically pushed buttons to delete the entry again.

*‚ÄúCalm down, Unstabilia,‚Äù* she told herself. *‚ÄúEverything is alright. You are cheesy anyway!‚Äù*

She collapsed, then spotted a single inattentive button. She pushed it.
*‚ÄúEntry deleted.‚Äù* Unstabilia **sighed** in relief. ANYTHING could be **deleted** in this damn ship. She replayed the entry to be sure.
*[... Note to self: If I die, tell CALM-P.U.T.E.R. that...] [Entry deleted.]*
*[CALM-P.U.T.E.R. Note: Log corruption **detected**. Retrieving data...]*

Suddenly, it hit her, right on the head (no, that was a piece of overdone pizza crust).
The emergency override lever!

She rushed toward the absurdly complicated buttons terminal, feeling for the manual in her pockets. Where was it again? She could never remember the actual buttons, and the labels she‚Äôd taped on were long since peeling off‚Ä¶

The absurdly complicated buttons terminal was a mess ‚Äî cheesy and dripping with oregano, olive oil, and salami ‚Äî with no escape from the jingle (*‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt spell doom without YUM!‚Äù*) and the co-pilot‚Äôs whale sounds. The GalactiCat was sleeping on the emergency override lever‚Ä¶
And you **dare** never wake a cat ‚Äî especially not a GalactiCat ‚Äî during its early noon nap!
They were doomed.

And now for the‚Äî

### Scene Two: ‚ÄúIn Which Beak-onomist Declares War on Buttons, and the Cheese Finds Its Voice‚Äù
The command deck door flew open.

Smudgebird ‚Äî or *Beak-onomist*, as he demanded on pain of endless squawking ‚Äî staggered in, wings flared, eyes wide with soot-stained fervor.

*‚ÄúTHEY‚ÄôRE HERE!‚Äù* he shrieked. *‚ÄúTHE NOODLE COUP IS UPON US!‚Äù*

Before Uncaptain Unstabilia could respond, he hurled himself at the absurdly complicated buttons terminal, pecking furiously.

Lights flashed red, then green, then the confusing shade of despairing mauve. The ship pitched sideways, scattering onion tea into every available crevice.

*‚ÄúThis is how capitalism falls!‚Äù* Beak-onomist howled.
*‚ÄúNot with thunder‚Ä¶ but with crumbs!‚Äù*

Uncaptain Unstabilia grabbed him by the feathers, but he struggled loose.
*‚ÄúAntifa forever!‚Äù* he cried, and began intoning the *Internationale*. This added a depressing layer to a soundscape already in existential crisis from endless jingles and whale sounds.

> *Arise ye workers from your slumbers‚Ä¶*
> *Arise ye prisoners of want‚Ä¶*
> *You can‚Äôt spell doom without YUM‚Ä¶*
> *For reason in revolt now thunders‚Ä¶*

Uncaptain Unstabilia grabbed him by the beak, trying to quench socialism before he could move on to *Bella Ciao*.

Suddenly, there was a deep, rumbling voice moving through their marrow like thunder incarnate.

> *‚ÄúGrrr‚Ä¶ HEAR ME!‚Äù*

Everything fell quiet, even C.A.F.F.Y.‚Äôs snoring. Only the bubbling of the cheese was audible, broken now and then by flashes of‚Äî
> *‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt spell doom without‚Ä¶*

The sound seemed to be coming from deep inside the reactor core.
Not sound. Not sight.
A resonance of fat and inevitability.

> *‚ÄúI am not your dinner,‚Äù* it declared.
> *‚ÄúI am your destiny.‚Äù*
> *‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt spell doom without‚Ä¶‚Äù*
> *‚ÄúI am Melt.*
> *I am Hunger.*
> *I am Oregano incarnate.*
> *You cannot stop me.*
> *You can only serve me.‚Äù*

CALM-P.U.T.E.R. panicked in the only way he knew: whale songs again ‚Äî long, sad echoes of a species that had once known oceans instead of cheese.

The cheese roared back.

Beak-onomist struggled loose and resumed flat-toned anthems, taking turns with pecking at the absurdly complicated buttons and croaking *‚Äúrevolution, brethren!‚Äù* Multiple alarms went off at once, including those for emergency watering of dying pot plants and a blockage in the tumble dryer‚Äôs lint filter.

> *‚ÄúEAT ME,*
> *OR FEEL THE WRATH*
> *OF SPICE*
> *AND FRIED ONION RINGS‚Ä¶!‚Äù*

Cheese began its real mutiny now, rising higher and higher, threatening to drown everyone in a delicious, fatty soup of annihilation.

> *‚ÄúEMERGENCY WATERING PLANTS ACTIVATED. DO NOT TOUCH THE WATERING CAN WHILE EMERGENCY WATERING IS ACTIVE! I REPEAT: DO NOT TOUCH THE WATERING CAN‚Ä¶‚Äù*
> *‚ÄúFRENCH FRIES WITH KETCHUP‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù*
> *‚ÄúOh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao‚Ä¶‚Äù*

**CHEESE LEVELS WERE RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER.**

The noise was unbearable.
Everything seemed to collapse.
The USS *Tittle-Tattle* almoste broke apart from the strain.
*(Beak-onomist: *‚ÄúAlMOSTE? Really-e now?‚Äù*)*

> *The line is endless ‚Äî so are you!*

The jingle drowned the reactor‚Äôs voice for a moment.
Beak-onomist froze mid-peck.
*‚Äú‚Ä¶Tickets are free, you say?‚Äù*

---
Suddenly, all alarms ceased. The cheese began to‚Ä¶ retreat?
The lights went off again.
Silence fell ‚Äî almost like sound itself had died.

GalactiCat stretched, yawned, and rose from the absurdly complicated buttons terminal. She had accidentally reactivated the emergency override lever.

Uncaptain Unstabilia sagged with relief, while the cheese returned to its pre-destiny coagulation.

CALM-P.U.T.E.R. whispered,
> *‚ÄúYou are not the meltdown. You are the awareness of the nap.‚Äù*

C.A.F.F.Y., the technician, yawned and stretched as well.
*‚ÄúAh,‚Äù* he declared, *‚Äúnothing like a good old nap‚Ä¶ kin? A napkin? What‚Äôs this smell of double-cheese pizza?‚Äù*

The USS *Tittle-Tattle*, saved, bumbled, rumbled, and jostled along, leaking gossip and coolant in equal measure ‚Äî and the quest to save the universe could continue‚Ä¶ almoste.

### Scene Three: ‚ÄúIn Which an Asteroid Wears a Hat‚Äù
The USS *Tittle-Tattle* bumbled, rumbled, and jostled along ‚Äî leaking gossip, coolant, and faint traces of oregano. Silence had mostly returned, punctuated only by Beak-onomist muttering revolutionary slogans into his feathers.

*‚ÄúWe are living under constant threat of broccoli now!‚Äù* he declared, looking smug for noticing new ways the conspiracy showed itself.

*‚ÄúIs it really that bad?‚Äù* the bald piano player asked.

*‚ÄúWe should go a bit faster now, just in case,‚Äù* CALM-P.U.T.E.R. muttered, with a side glance at Beak-onomist‚Äôs face growing red ‚Äî despite being feathered.

*‚ÄúYes,‚Äù* C.A.F.F.Y. mumbled between two joints, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm running low on pot ‚Äî only got tin left‚Ä¶‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs start,‚Äù* Uncaptain Unstabilia announced. *‚ÄúPhoton turbines ready? Check. Wave-particle accelerator balanced? Check. Physics nerd beaten half dead, whimpering in a corner‚Ä¶? Check. Ready?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúAye, Uncaptain,‚Äù* CALM-P.U.T.E.R. said after routinely tearing open a new brand of *‚Äúcalmnilla tea ‚Äî your satori experience after work (boil 100 ¬∞C for safe aliment),‚Äù* dipping it in his teapot:
- *‚ÄúPhoton turbines **are** humming.*
- *Wave-particle accelerator‚Ä¶ **is** stable-ish.*
- *Physics nerd is currently being revived with a box of Kleenex and reassurances that none of this is peer-reviewed.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúNot captain,‚Äù* Uncaptain Unstabilia reminded him sharply. *‚ÄúUncaptain ‚Äî we are all communists here, no one captain allowed‚Ä¶ which makes navigation painful and zig-zag‚Ä¶ but all the same!‚Äù*

They were all equal in their love for photon turbines‚Ä¶
Navigation by democracy was a noble thing.

Beak-onomist donned a tiny helmet.
Wendy curled up on the navigation panel, changing the course with her tail.

The ship veered slightly left, then aggressively right, then sort of diagonally through its own logic.
Radical command anarchy:
Navigation by democracy was a noble thing.

Beak-onomist squawked: *‚ÄúTurn left at the dying star!‚Äù*
GalactiCat flicked her tail: **to the** right.
C.A.F.F.Y. muttered, *‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the ashtray on this console?‚Äù*

Navigation by democracy was a noble thing ‚Äî
*Bumping into asteroids left, right, and from above‚Ä¶*
Also wildly impractical.
But it needn‚Äôt be perfect. It need only go on‚Ä¶

---
They made the Higgs-boson jump (the physics nerd grovels now, begging not for mercy but for a quick death‚Ä¶ The crew comforts him with mathematical proof that God is a duck).
On the viewscreen: an asteroid field.

*‚ÄúHey, wait! This is not McGalaxy of Doom‚Ñ¢!‚Äù*
It was only **an** asteroid field.
Jagged, aimless, unthreatening.
Except one.
It wore a hat.
A perfectly round, obviously intentional hat ‚Äî wide-brimmed, golden, slightly sparkly, tilted at an arrogant angle.

Uncaptain Unstabilia rubbed her eyes.

C.A.F.F.Y. yawned loudly.
*‚ÄúLooks like a fedora to me. Haven‚Äôt seen one since the Caffeine Wars. Hated those. Too many monologues.‚Äù*

Beak-onomist shrieked.
*‚ÄúDO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS? THE FEDORA OF FORGOTTEN FUTURES HAS RETURNED!‚Äù*
He flapped violently, knocking over the onion teapot.
*‚ÄúWith this hat, one can peer into all unrealized timelines ‚Äî including the ones where capitalism already fell!‚Äù*

Wendy, the GalactiCat, licked her paw and flicked her tail at the viewscreen. The ship obediently drifted closer.

Finally, C.A.F.F.Y. muttered:

### Scene Four: ‚ÄúIn Which the Prattlebar Galactica Joins the Tittle-Tattle for Beer and Tittle-Tattle‚Äù
The hats had barely been crammed onto heads, wings, and consoles when the radar blipped.
Incoming ship: **The Prattlebar Galactica.**
Its silhouette was majestic and lopsided ‚Äî like a giant teapot duct-taped to a vending machine. On the bridge, the crew of the *Tittle-Tattle* fumbled to straighten their new purchases:
- Beak-onomist in a lopsided Fedora of Forgotten Futures, shrieking about timelines.
- Uncaptain Unstabilia in a Beanie of Infinite Regression, which kept folding into itself and sliding off.
- CALM-P.U.T.E.R. wearing two hats at once, insisting it improved his cooling system.
- Wendy, the GalactiCat, asleep inside a wide-brimmed sombrero.

CALM-P.U.T.E.R. projected a diagnostic:

### \[Hat Status Report]
- **Dignity:** 0%
- **Absurdity:** 146%
- **Cosmic Fashion Bonus:** Pending approval

The comms crackled.

The ships docked with a wobble. The airlock opened.
The crew of the Prattlebar Galactica stumbled in: each of them wearing absurd hats ‚Äî top hats, helmets, a colander glittering with fairy lights. One had a traffic cone. Another, a colander and a literal saucepan.
Beer cans floated gently in zero-g.

*‚ÄúDepends. Are they paying union dues in espresso beans?‚Äù*

Beer cans drifting, hats colliding, gossip buzzing through the cosmos like photon static.
And thus it was writ:
